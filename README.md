This is a project for a converted EV (from Toyota Hilux) 
The VCU sends CAN data
The speed and battery voltage were displayed on the 16x02 LCD display with an arduino(atmega328p)
For can reading MCP2515 module was used. So nothing fancy in the hardware side. 
Just added a diode (1n4007) as reverse polarity protection in the input side.
